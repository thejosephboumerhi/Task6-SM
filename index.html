    <title> Task 06 - Social Media/Rabbit Hole!</title>

<div class="homeDiv">
  <p> We are doing our project on social media, its effects of it on people, while extending to more sensitive matters</p>
  <ul>
    <p>Based on the video we’ve looked, it features an interesting figure within the world of tech, Jason Lanier, who is known
         for his work with “Silicon Valley” and shares his opinions on the matter. While the simpler effects can be observed, like how
         one might become “obsessive” or “irritable” through an excessive use of media, like “Trump’s use of Twitter”, and how we can get
         a rush of emotions through our connecting and disputing (Channel 4, 14:07-15:22).</p></li>
    <li><p>There’s the matter of the algorithms searching and looking for things that might interests you like advertising, topics, and groups
         of interest, while in the sense it is good to get things pertaining to your needs and views, it can create a tunnel vision, and almost 
         shoves you into an echo chamber. The big social media sites use a form of “manipulative and addictive scheme”, to influence the users
         and mold them a certain way (Channel 4, 6:10-7:13). </p></li>
    <li><p>Extending this to the political field, a heinous case of social media manipulation in relation of our “data”, that example that would
         be made is the Trump election and “Cambridge Analytica” (Channel 4, 7:20-8:30), where “data” was utilized to curve how people would vote.
         So now we’ve seen that these issues aren’t exclusive to the field of tech, it also extends onto others. The video we had watched had given 
         a good idea on what to look at and see it from different angles. </p></li>
